********************project Description***************************


This is a contact manager app
 
Technology used: 
            frontend: html,css,javascript,bootstrap 5.0
            Backend: Node js,Express js,MongoDB

For authentication i have used passport js which will be very helpful with the signup and login form

Inside the project I have handled routes like

signup: allows user to register. And the user information is stored in the db for future use like login

login: allows user to login. Checks if the user contains in the database or not. if the user does not exist in the database the user need to register

new : adds new contact to the database. if the user gives same number it gives alert message. if two user has same name but different numbers it creates duplicate contact.

index: in this page we can view the contact added. We can edit and delete.
